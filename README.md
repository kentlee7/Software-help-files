# Software-help-files
Various short help &amp; trouble-shooting files for different programs 

I occasionally deal with software glitches, or minor Linux problems. When I figure them out, I like to post them here, so others can benefit. So far, here is what I have. 

* Obsidian error message: Too many files open (in Ubuntu)
* Distrubuted line justification in LibreOffice Writer
* Installing double-sided SSDs in a laptop
* Switching from VirtualBox to KVM / QEMU
